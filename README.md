# Machine Learning and Blockchain for Transaction Fraud Detection

The prevalence of financial fraud is a growing concern in today's digital world. Despite technological advancements, privacy concerns often hinder collaboration and information exchange among entities. However, leveraging machine learning (ML) technologies can significantly enhance fraud detection capabilities by analyzing massive volumes of transactional data.

This project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection system using various ML algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). By employing supervised learning methods, our system aims to identify trends indicative of fraudulent activities within financial transactions.

## Key Features

- Utilizes supervised learning algorithms for fraud detection.
- Incentivizes data sharing among entities by offering prizes based on data contribution difficulty.
- Implements effective blockchain block mining methods to maintain system integrity.
- Evaluates system performance across different data volumes and complexity levels.
- Calculates F Beta score to assess model accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's [Paysim1 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1). 
- It provides a comprehensive collection of transactional data for training and evaluating our fraud detection models.
- The dataset includes various features such as transaction type, amount, balance, and more, making it suitable for analyzing fraudulent activities within     
  financial transactions.
